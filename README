Pikpoint synchronizes projects and actions from a locally running
OmniFocus (OF) application with stories in an AgileZen (AZ) project.

Each OF project corresponds to an AZ story.  An OF project's name,
folder name, and context are displayed in its AZ story's text.  The OF
project's notes and identifier are displayed in the AZ story's
details.  Each OF task in a project corresponds to an AZ task in the
corresponding story.  The tasks order is respected.

During synchronization:
- Any non-completed AZ story that doesn't contain any OF project
  identifier, or doesn't match any existing OF project, is deleted.
- An AZ story is created for every OF project not already matched with
  any AZ story, in the "Ready" phase (the first phase after the
  "Backlog").
- Any changes to an OF project is updated in its corresponding AZ
  story.  Any changes made to an AZ story in AgileZen, except any
  change of phase, is ignored and overriten with the OF project's
  information.
- If an OF project is completed, its corresponding AZ story is moved
  to the "Done" phase (the last phase before the "Archive").
  Symmetrically, if an AZ story is in the "Done" or "Archive" phase,
  its corresponding OF project is marked as completed.

OmniFocus is considered the golden copy of project and task
information: information is always copied from OmniFocus to AgileZen.
The only exception is the completion status: moving an AgileZen story
into a completed phase makes its corresponding project marked as
completed in OmniFocus, and checking a AgileZen task as completed
makes its corresponding task marked as completed in OmniFocus.

The selection of OmniFocus projects to synchronize, as well as the
color of every project story in AgileZen, is easily configurable by
modifying the lambda functions in omnifocus2agilezen.py.

Feedback, bug reports, and patches are highly appreciated!
